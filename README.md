# Negative Probability: Forward-Backward Algorithm

Here is the project's website for our paper titled "Negative Probabilities in Gene Regulatory Networks" 

The paper can be accessed at [insert link to the paper].

In this project, we introduce two key algorithms: the Forward-Backward algorithm (fb.m) and the Gradient Descent method (gd.m).

i) The data for the large-scale example can be found in the "example_data" folder.

ii) All the functions used in the paper are available in the "function_backup" folder.

iii) For reproducing the experiments conducted in the paper, you can utilize the code provided in the "convergence_comp" folder.
