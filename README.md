# Negative Probability: Forward-Backward Algorithm

Here is the project's website for our paper titled "Negative Probabilities in Gene Regulatory Networks" 

The paper can be accessed at [insert link to the paper].

In this project, we introduce a salient algorithm: the Forward-Backward algorithm (fb.m), and verified its results by the Gradient Descent method (gd.m).

i) The data for the large-scale example can be found in the "example_data" folder.

ii) All the functions used in the paper are available in the "function" folder.

iii) For reproducing the experiments conducted in the paper, you can utilize the code provided in the "convergence.m".
