# Negative Probability: Forward-Backward Algorithm
Here is the project's website of our paper "Negative probabilities in Gene Regulatory Networks"
by Anqi Dong, Tryphon T. Georgiou, Allen Tannenbaum.

The paper can be found from ...
Herein, we present the Forward-Backward algorithm (fb.m) and the Gradient Descent method (gd.m). 

1. The data of the large-scale example can be found in the folder -- example_data.
2. All the functions used in the paper can be found in the folder -- function_backup 
3. All the experiments conducted in the paper can use the code in convergence_comp
